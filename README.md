# employee-html-generator

## Description
This is a program using node.js from the command line that allows you to generate HTML for a team of employees from simple user input. Different employees and different information are made available for input, then are written to an HTML file named 'team.html' in a separate folder named 'output'. This program is an exercise in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where the different employe types are children of the employee object.
